Affectionately known as Herc's Corner, our blog was officially born on September 19, 2019. The name Herc's Corner comes from TU's former mascot Herc the Hurricane. Our goal with this blog is to dive deeper into stats, explore TU history, and write about interesting milestones as Tulsa athletics continues to progress. Matt (former Sports Editor for The Collegian) kicked things off by writing a couple stat-focused articles, and Ryan joined in with {\"\"}\n          <a\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            href=\"https://www.thegoldenhurricast.com/Rivalries\"\n          >\n            \"Tulsa vs Everybody: Picking New Rivals\"\n          </a>\n          . It's been a joint effort ever since.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The blog was going well, but we became unhappy with the WordPress URL\n          (hercscorner.home.blog) and some of the other WordPress limitations.\n          Fortunately, Ryan works as an application developer and decided to\n          build us our own custom website!
