With this post, we are introducing comments throughout the blog! This applies to all previous and future blog posts.

<br />

#### Overview

<br />

We're using [Disqus](https://disqus.com) for our comments system. We chose Disqus over a plethora of other options for the following reasons:

- It's widely used.
- It’s easier to comment: Disqus has a large existing user base and the onboarding experience for new users is fast. You can register with your Google, Facebook or Twitter accounts and users can more seamlessly share the comments they write through those channels.
- It's fast. Adding this functionality won’t negatively impact the load time of our posts.
- It fits in nicely with how we've already built the site.

There are some things you should know before you get started with commenting:

<br />

#### Create a Disqus Account

<br />

You'll need a Disqus account in order to comment on our posts.

The basic steps to create an account, and the benefits of doing so, can be found [here](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717153-registering-a-commenter-account).

<br />

#### The Ground Rules

<br />

We encourage lively discussion, but ask that you please be respectful of others. Personal attacks are prohibited and will be deleted.

<br />

#### General Info on Commenting

<br />

Disqus offers a host of other tips, tricks, and recommendations if you want to take a closer look at everything.
