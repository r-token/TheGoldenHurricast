Well friends, Tulsa's basketball season came to an unfortunate and early end. Tulsa, the #7 seed, took on a 9-12 Tulane team (4-12 AAC) on Thursday in Fort Worth and lost by seven.

A disappointing end to a disappointing season.

Notably, Frank Haith's contract is up at the end of next season. A decision on whether to extend him or fire him will be made this year. According to the <a href="https://tulsaworld.com/sports/college/tu/interim-removed-from-rick-dicksons-title-making-him-tu-athletic-director/article_3b4fa26e-7075-11eb-abdb-0738165d03d8.html" target="_blank">Tulsa World</a>, ~~Interim~~ AD Rick Dickson said he hopes to have both Frank Haith's and Philip Montgomery's contract situations resolved by July.

So it's decision time for Rick Dickson.

Following the first-round conference tournament loss to Tulane, Kelly Hines asked Frank Haith if he expects to be the head coach next year. Haith replied with the following:

> "I don’t anticipate not being the head coach. We won the conference championship last year and we had 10 new players and we have a pandemic. If I’m judged on this season, based on what we did last year, that would be very disappointing."

Fair enough, no one should be judged on the results of one season. So let's look at Haith's seven-year tenure at TU and see how he stacks up.

#### Examining the Results

<br />

So Haith just concluded his seventh season at TU. His overall record here is 127-88, good for a 59.3% win-loss percentage.

He's made one NCAA tournament, his average KenPom ranking is 104, and he's had two losing seasons.

"But you're Tulsa, you shouldn't expect to be consistently strong in the AAC". I hear you, non-Tulsa fan who is reading this, but you are wrong.

Tulsa men's basketball has a long history of success. Fourteen NCAA tournament appearances, eleven regular-season conference championships (one AAC), six conference tournament championships, four sweet sixteens, and one elite eight. A long line of incredible head coaches including Nolan Richardson, Tubby Smith, and Bill Self, among others.

From 1994-2000, Tulsa made the NCAA tournament six out of seven years. Half were in the Missouri Valley Conference, half were in the Western Athletic Conference. Five of those six appearances were as at-large bids.

Tulsa has proven it can achieve that level of success. Frank Haith has not proven that he can be the man to get us back there.

Here's how Haith's KenPom results stack up against former Tulsa coaches going back to 1997, courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/tulsahop/status/1370140824588095488?s=21" target="_blank">Tulsa Hop</a>. I added the final numbers at each point in the chart.

** Insert image of KenPom Results here **

The first thing you might notice from Haith's KenPom numbers is that there's no steady trend. It's a wild ride with no consistent line up or down. That's not the case for any of the other coaches in this chart.

Two of his three best years were with guys he didn't recruit: James Woodard, Shaq Harrison, D'Andre Wright, Pat Birt, Rashad Ray/Smith, etc. If we remove those Tulsa years from his resume, his average KenPom ranking drops to 115 with two losing seasons.

Last season was clearly a high point for Haith. A regular season AAC co-championship, a first-team all-conference player in Martins Igbanu, and Haith named the AAC Coach of the Year after being picked to finish 10th (!) in the league preseason.

It also would have resulted in postseason play, though likely the NIT seeing as no brackets had us in the NCAA tournament as an at-large bid and we had just suffered a 22-point blowout loss at the hands of Wichita State. The postseason was canceled altogether due to COVID-19.

Going back to the chart. If the cycle of better-then-worse-then-better holds, we should improve next year.

Unfortunately, it's difficult to see that happening. Who were our best players this year? The answer is unequivocally Brandon Rachal, Elijah Joiner, and Darien Jackson. They are all seniors. Granted, they could all return next year due to the NCAA granting an extra year of eligibility to all college basketball players due to COVID-19.

In a normal year, though, those guys would all be gone. We'd be left with a promising forward in Rey Idowu, an inconsistent-to-poor outside shooting game with Curtis Haywood, Keyshawn Embery-Simpson, and Austin Richie, and some young guys still proving themselves. It's hard to imagine an uptick next year.

The back half of <a href="https://tulsaworld.com/sports/college/tu/bill-haisten-its-decision-time-for-tu----extend-frank-haiths-contract-or/article_400a57be-7880-11eb-b5a0-97ca4181c3d2.html" target="_blank">this Tulsa World article by Bill Haisten</a> does a solid, concise comparison of Frank Haith and Doug Wojcik. This is a comparison I've seen more and more frequently over the last several weeks.

To summarize: they have nearly the same winning percentage (Wojcik's was actually higher), there is a lack of postseason appearances, and attendance at home games plummeted for both.

The paragraph that stuck out to me most was the following:
> "During the 2019-20 season, TU’s home attendance average was the lowest in the 23-season history of the Reynolds Center. It was worse than in 2011-12, when Wojcik was fired in part because of poor attendance."

During Haith's best season with all his established players, the program is at an all-time low in terms of attendance. That is ... not good.

<br />

#### Program Apathy

<br />

Bill concludes his post by confronting the problem of apathy within the program. While I was at TU from 2013-2017, I understood this on a fundamental level. It's tough to get TU students widely engaged in athletics. I spent far too much of my time as a student trying to get people to come to games with me.

When Danny Manning was hired, there was a real sense of excitement for the basketball program though. People wanted to go watch the team. And they were fun to watch.

It was a blow when Manning left for Wake Forest, but most people were willing to give Frank Haith a fair shot. Early on in Haith's tenure, excitement stayed relatively high among students because we were successful and made the postseason two years straight (NIT 2015, NCAA Tournament 2016).

It feels like a steady decline in terms of excitement since 2016 though. Primarily disappointing seasons with one good blip last year. But even that good blip did nothing to help fan support.

<br />

#### The Cases For Frank Haith

<br />

- 2019-2020 regular season AAC co-champions
- 2019-2020 AAC coach of the year
- An established, stable head coach
- Runs the program with class
- Willingly took a pay cut

<br />

#### The Cases Against Frank Haith

<br />

- One NCAA Tournament bid
- Zero NCAA Tournament wins
- Zero top-100 teams in points per game, four in the 200s
- Declining home attendance
- 104 average KenPom ranking

<br />

#### Decision Time

<br />

So what does Rick Dickson do?

Does he fire the coach who just last season led TU to a share of the conference championship and won the AAC Coach of the Year?

Does he retain the coach who has one (fortunate) NCAA Tournament appearance and who has otherwise been a middling coach with one good blip in the last five years?

Does he fire a good man who willingly took a pay cut when Tulsa needed it and who has run a clean program?

Does he retain the coach who severely underperformed this year and who doesn't seem to have recruited the talent to properly replace our outgoing seniors?

We are at a tipping point.

If we extend Frank Haith again, I'm legitimately worried about a consistent decline in the program. Do we think Haith is going to be the one to return Tulsa to its former glory? Can he get us to the NCAA Tournament in any kind of consistent manner?

I think fans have answered with attendance numbers, and Haith has not performed well enough to overcome that significant shortcoming.

People just don't care about Tulsa basketball right now.

Last season alone should not save his job.

The program needs a reboot.

Frank Haith is a good man, but it's time to find a new head coach.

Discussing a head coaching change is always going to be a polarizing topic. I've given some of my perspective here, but I'm just me. I want to know what you think.
