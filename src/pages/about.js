            Inspired by the past success of the late Reign Cane Sports podcast,
            The Golden Hurricast took up the mantle and officially debuted in
            August of 2018. Our first podcast episode was titled 'Stay Golden',
            and we still open each episode of our podcast with an audio clip of
            Dane Evans saying that at the end of our interview with him.

            You can find our podcast on <b>10 different platforms</b>, including
            Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Stitcher, Overcast, Breaker,
            PocketCasts, and more. Just search for "The Golden Hurricast".

            In the fall of 2019, we decided to up our game a bit and create a
          blog. Affectionately known as Herc's Corner, our blog was officially born on September 19, 2019. The name Herc's Corner comes from TU's former mascot Herc the Hurricane. Our goal with this blog is to dive deeper into stats, explore TU history, and write about interesting milestones as Tulsa athletics continues to progress. Matt (former Sports Editor for The Collegian) kicked things off by writing a couple stat-focused articles, and Ryan joined in with {""}

              "Tulsa vs Everybody: Picking New Rivals"
          </a>
            . It's been a joint effort ever since.
        </p>

          <p>
            The blog was going well, but we became unhappy with the WordPress URL
            (hercscorner.home.blog) and some of the other WordPress limitations.
            Fortunately, Ryan works as an application developer and decided to
          build us our own custom website! Thus,{" "}
            <a href="https://thegoldenhurricast.com">TheGoldenHurricast.com</a>{" "}
            was born. We have high hopes for the website, so let us know if
            there's anything you'd like us to add in the future.
