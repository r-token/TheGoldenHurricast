With the recent decision by the American Athletic Conference to get rid of divisions starting next football season, the concern came up about maintaining some natural rivalries between schools because of the new rotating schedule. One possible solution people have suggested was the creation of two new permanent rivals for every school that you would play each year while the rest of the schedule rotates. \nThis creates the exciting question of just who those rivals would be for Tulsa. There are a lot of options, but there are four in particular that we think make the most sense.

The matchup has got everything you could ask for: history, (general) proximity, old grudges and more. Tulsa is Houston’s most played opponent in their history and Houston is our 4th most played, technically the second highest in the conference after Wichita State, but highest with an active football program. \nWe’ve been in the same conference for almost 25 years spanning the Missouri Valley and Conference USA, but even when we were independents we played almost every year. Not only are we Houston’s most played opponent, but we’re the only team in the top-5 that isn’t from Texas. The team from Tulsa, OK was the first college team to win a game in the Astrodome for goodness’ sake! What more could you ask for? \nHow about a 50-year old grudge? One of Houston’s biggest feats in their football history was at Tulsa’s expense. I’m referring, of course, to the infamous Astrodome game in 1968. That matchup is infamous because Tulsa’s entire team came down with the flu, bravely battled through the sickness and narrowly lost to Houston 100–6. No other college team has scored 100 points in a football game since. I don’t know about you, but this makes me, someone born 27 years after this game took place, irrationally angry just thinking about it.\nAfter playing each other 30 times from 1950 through 1993, we turned up the intensity when we were rejoined in the C-USA West Division in 2005. In the eight years we were in C-USA together Tulsa (4) and Houston (3) dominated the West, with one of us winning the division seven out of eight years. \nEven in recent history, as Tulsa has struggled to maintain football consistency and has lost four of the last five matchups, the games have remained competitive, with the biggest blowout actually coming in the season that we went 2–10 when we won 45–17. (Also they had too many men on the field in 2016 and we should have won that game, I’ll fight anyone who disagrees with me).\nThough Houston is further away than both SMU and Memphis, it’s still the third closest football school in our conference. It’s a reasonable travel destination and the city itself is massive and has loads of fun stuff to do and see. Plus it’s got the oil connection. Tulsa’s bread and butter industry is oil. Tons of energy companies started in or around the Tulsa area. Houston’s biggest market is oil as well (although they might be a wee bit bigger of a market). I think the only school that would even be on the same level as Houston would be SMU just because it’s the easiest school to travel to.

However, as you’ll read next, I list SMU as my favorite rivalry candidate. So Houston isn’t my first choice, and I’m likely going to stoke the fire a bit when I say this, but Houston wouldn’t even be my second choice for a rivalry opponent. \nI have a deep level of respect for our history with Houston, and would be thrilled if we did get to play them every year, but I think there are two other options in this list that would be even better. Since I can’t add more for why Houston would make for a great rivalry on top of what Matt’s already said, I’ll argue for why they shouldn’t be our rival:\nOnce given the opportunity, it is clear that Houston will jump to leave the AAC for a Power Five conference. They are spending Power Five dollars on coaches for both basketball (retaining Kelvin Sampson) and football (pulling Dana Holgorsen from P5 West Virginia). They are spending Power Five dollars on facilities (appx. $275 million since 2014). And they have a Power Five-like booster in Tilman Fertitta, who ponies up the money they need for projects like this. \nWhen the Big 12 was doing their whole open-tryout for joining the conference in 2016, Houston was at the top of nearly everyone’s list as a potential team to get the call. Their AD at the time, Hunter Yuracheck, said that Houston is ready to do “whatever we have to do” to join the Big 12. Yuracheck is now the AD at Arkansas, but their philosophy remains the same. The current university president, Renu Khator, is on the Big 12 warpath. There’s even a clause in head football coach Dana Holgorsen’s contract that states if UH is invited to join a Power Five conference at any time during his contract, he will receive a $1 million bonus and unspecified salary increase. \nSo make no mistake, this is what Houston wants, and it would be very disappointing to lose a rival to another conference. Part of me says to myself, “well, we should enjoy it while we have it, then”. But if Houston is just waiting to get out of this conference, they’re not going to be as excited to play us, and I want a rivalry game that has both teams excited to play each other  every year. Because of this, I’m looking to the future and would rather create a rivalry with a newer, improving foe with which we share many commonalities.\nMy other argument against Houston is purely a selfish one. I like to travel, and will very likely be traveling to these rivalry games whenever they’re away. Considering the fact that my #1 vote went to SMU, I’d rather our second permanent opponent not also be in the state of Texas simply for the purposes of travel diversity. A bit silly, and certainly selfish, but I’d definitely enjoy it more if one of our rivalry games was in Texas and the other was in Memphis or New Orleans.

As far as I know, the below screenshots are the only two tweets from TU that ever reference this name.\nThe first reference: December 29, 2015\nThe second and final reference: February 9, 2016\nOnly two references ever, but I was hooked from the beginning. Why did they get rid of it? I have no idea. Please bring this back, @TulsaHurricane.\nSecond, we are two very similar schools. Of the four options we’re discussing here, SMU’s 6,500 undergraduates are the closest to Tulsa’s 3,200. TU loves to tout that it’s the smallest D-I FBS school, and having a bona-fide rivalry with a school this close in size simply makes sense. \nTulsa and SMU are similar in several ways beyond just student population as well. We are both private universities who have a basis in Protestant Christianity (Tulsa: Presbyterian, SMU: Methodist), we both have endowments of over one billion dollars, we both have blue and red in our colors, we’re both in the northeastern corner of our respective states, etc. I could go on, but I’ll stop there for all of your sakes. Bottom line: we’re similar schools, and that adds to a fun rivalry.\nThird, and most obviously, we’re close by. Except for Wichita State—who doesn’t play football—SMU is the closest school to us in the conference; and it’s easy to get there. If you leave straight from TU, just take 75-South for about 255 miles and you’ll pretty much be on SMU’s campus. If you want a good rivalry game, make it easy for fans to travel to the opposing school. It doesn’t get much easier than that.\nAnd finally, we have a lot of history. As noted above, we first played in 1935—much earlier than all of the other options we have here. However, we are behind both Houston and Memphis in number of total matchups. Regardless, games against SMU always seem to be good, hard-fought battles. Just last year, SMU was a 5-win team, and a 2–9 Tulsa team beat them in the last game of the season to keep them out of a bowl game. \nFurther, there hasn’t been a game decided by more than ten points since 2011 when we beat SMU 38–7. It’s almost always a good game, and you can’t ask for more than that. We also have a fantastic history in basketball. The most notable recent basketball games that come to mind include the 2015-2016 season when Tulsa beat #16 SMU on the road to break their 15-game home winning streak, and in 2014 when James Woodard set a conference record, hitting ten three-pointers against SMU in a loss in the American Conference tournament.\nShould the conference choose to go with two permanent rivalry games for each team starting next season, SMU needs to be one of those two teams.","position":{"start":{"line":46,"column":1,"offset":7788},"end":{"line":55,"column":144,"offset":10556},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":46,"column":1,"offset":7788},"end":{"line":55,"column":144,"offset":10556},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Potential rivalry name: The Boomtown Showdown (of course)","position":{"start":{"line":58,"column":1,"offset":10561},"end":{"line":58,"column":58,"offset":10618},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":58,"column":1,"offset":10561},"end":{"line":58,"column":58,"offset":10618},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":4,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Matt","position":{"start":{"line":60,"column":6,"offset":10625},"end":{"line":60,"column":10,"offset":10629},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":60,"column":1,"offset":10620},"end":{"line":60,"column":10,"offset":10629},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Ryan pretty much nailed it on the head here.
