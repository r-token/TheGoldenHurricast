This is a weekly column where I’ll focus on some stats that I think are having an impact on Tulsa’s football season.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The first two weeks of college football are over and the Golden Hurricane sit at 1–1, a record that I imagine all but the most optimistic (or pessimistic for that matter) were expecting after back-to-back games against the Spartans. With roughly one-sixth of the season over—roughly because it will be thirteen games not twelve when Tulsa makes a bowl game—it seems like a great time to look at some of the statistics that explain Tulsa’s season so far.</p>\n<p>Just a note before we get started, two games is a very small sample size so results may vary going forward. With that said, let’s dive in.</p>\n<h2>Three Key Factors</h2>\n<br />\nIf you listened to our [season preview](https://anchor.fm/thegoldenhurricast/episodes/2-3-Meet-the-Spartans-e54kh2) (36:35) episode before the Michigan State game you may remember that Pat, Ryan and I each picked a stat that we think will be the key to our success or lack thereof this season. If you forgot, or didn’t get a chance to listen here’s a refresher:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pat:</strong> Yards Per Passing Attempt. (YDs / Att) Zach Smith is strong on the deep ball, so him throwing deep more often than we did last year is essential to our success.</li>\n<li><strong>Ryan:</strong> Total Quarterback Rating. (QBR) 29.4 QBR rating last season, and our quarterback play is a big contributor to how our offense is rolling.</li>\n<li><strong>Matt:</strong> Average Third Down Distance. We were shooting ourselves in the foot by not having successful first and second down plays, making it harder overall to convert and also taking away potential options for play-calling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the quarterback search that Tulsa went through after the 2016 season it might not be a surprise that these three are all connected how well Zach Smith plays. We at the Golden Hurricast have a lot of confidence in the skill of our football team and if the QB plays well then our view is that the overall success of the team will follow.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how these stats played out over the first two weeks.</p>\n<h2>Ryan</h2>\n<p>I agree with Pat in that I’m not surprised the coaches picked us to finish tenth in the conference. I’m more than used to the #disrespect this point. However, just because I’m not surprised doesn’t mean I agree. Tulsa will finish better than tenth this year, and Frank Haith will continue his good-but-bad streak of always finishing higher than where his teams are picked in the preseason standings.</p>\n<p>We lost a lot of talent last year with DaQuan Jeffries to the NBA, Sterling Taplin to Apollon Limassol in Cyprus, and Curran Scott to Clemson, but the big shoes that were left seem to have been filled. Jeriah Horne broke out in a big way last year and looks to take the reigns that DaQuan left him, Martins Igbanu and newcomer Emmanuel Ugboh make for a big, powerful front-court, and a mixture of Elijah Joiner, Brandon Rachal, highly touted freshman Isaiah Hill, and Darien Jackson creates an underrated and deceptively talented back-court. I think our back-court will actually be considerably improved this year compared to last year. Add in relative unknowns Josh Earley, Reggie Jones, and a potential breakout star in LSU transfer Brandon Rachal, and you’ve got what could actually be a surprisingly strong team.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we have even more talent on the bench that won’t be suiting up at all until next year. It sounds like Georgia Tech transfer Curtis Haywood is redshirting this season, and former four-star recruit and Arkansas transfer Keyshawn Embery-Simpson’s waiver to play this year was denied by the NCAA for undisclosed reasons. Both of those guys have an opportunity to improve during this season and add to an even better, senior-laden team next year.</p>\n<p>The teams picked to finish before us in the conference standings include a Temple team with a brand new head coach, an SMU team that has gotten worse essentially every year under Jankovich, a UCF team that is basically starting from scratch after losing their entire roster, and a UConn team that we continue to beat on a yearly basis. I’d say our ceiling this year is fifth place, but it’s more likely that we’ll end up at eighth ahead of SMU, UCF, ECU, and Tulane.</p>\n<h2>Matt</h2>\n<p>I’m not going to sugarcoat anything. I don’t really have high expectations for Tulsa this season. The American has become an arms race in the last couple of years, and I don’t think Tulsa has been keeping pace with a lot of teams in the conference. Memphis hired Penny Hardaway two years ago and he has made Memphis the top recruiter in the conference for the foreseeable future, Houston is coming off one of their best seasons ever and have back-to-back AAC coach of the year in Kelvin Sampson at the helm and Cincinnati had some addition by subtraction when Mick Cronin left for UCLA and they replaced him with Northern Kentucky’s John Brannen.</p>\n<p>Those are just the top teams in the conference but the key thing with those three and throughout the conference is I believe most of the teams have better coaches than Tulsa’s Frank Haith. I know that we are bringing in a ton of new players this season, and some of them look to be incredibly talented, but Haith hasn’t proven that he can win at a high-level with any talent that he has brought in here. There were too many games last season where he was clearly out-coached and I don’t know if the talent we have makes up for that—especially because there are a lot of guys playing together for the first time.</p>\n<p>So maybe my previous paragraphs don’t really justify this, but I do believe that we are better than the tenth best team in the conference. Kenpom has Tulsa listed as the ninth best team in the conference, so we’re already trending upwards! Tulane is moving in the right direction with Ron Hunter but they won’t be great this year, East Carolina has some good players but is still clearly the second weakest team in the conference, like Ryan said Central Florida will have a new look entirely after their successful season last year, and (benefit of writing just before publishing) Sunday saw the awful news that USF’s Alexis Yetna will miss the season because of a knee injury, and Southern Methodist will beat us head-to-head like normal, but Jankovich has increased their losses every season. Tulsa can be better than at least three of those teams (and maybe UConn because they #suck), so I think we will finish no worse than ninth in the conference with a chance for seventh. That’s technically positive, but I mean, barely right?</p>\n<br>"}
