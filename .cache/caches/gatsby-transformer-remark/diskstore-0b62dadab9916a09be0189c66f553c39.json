I am of course referring to rivalries. With the recent decision by the American Athletic Conference to get rid of divisions starting next football season, the concern came up about maintaining some natural rivalries between schools because of the new rotating schedule. One possible solution people have suggested was the creation of two new permanent rivals for every school that you would play each year while the rest of the schedule rotates. \nThis creates the exciting question of just who those rivals would be for Tulsa. There are a lot of options, but there are four in particular that we think make the most sense.

The matchup has got everything you could ask for: history, (general) proximity, old grudges and more. Tulsa is Houston’s most played opponent in their history and Houston is our 4th most played, technically the second highest in the conference after Wichita State, but highest with an active football program. \nWe’ve been in the same conference for almost 25 years spanning the Missouri Valley and Conference USA, but even when we were independents we played almost every year. Not only are we Houston’s most played opponent, but we’re the only team in the top-5 that isn’t from Texas. The team from Tulsa, OK was the first college team to win a game in the Astrodome for goodness’ sake! What more could you ask for? \nHow about a 50-year old grudge? One of Houston’s biggest feats in their football history was at Tulsa’s expense. I’m referring, of course, to the infamous Astrodome game in 1968. That matchup is infamous because Tulsa’s entire team came down with the flu, bravely battled through the sickness and narrowly lost to Houston 100–6. No other college team has scored 100 points in a football game since. I don’t know about you, but this makes me, someone born 27 years after this game took place, irrationally angry just thinking about it.\nAfter playing each other 30 times from 1950 through 1993, we turned up the intensity when we were rejoined in the C-USA West Division in 2005. In the eight years we were in C-USA together Tulsa (4) and Houston (3) dominated the West, with one of us winning the division seven out of eight years. \nEven in recent history, as Tulsa has struggled to maintain football consistency and has lost four of the last five matchups, the games have remained competitive, with the biggest blowout actually coming in the season that we went 2–10 when we won 45–17. (Also they had too many men on the field in 2016 and we should have won that game, I’ll fight anyone who disagrees with me).\nThough Houston is further away than both SMU and Memphis, it’s still the third closest football school in our conference. It’s a reasonable travel destination and the city itself is massive and has loads of fun stuff to do and see. Plus it’s got the oil connection. Tulsa’s bread and butter industry is oil. Tons of energy companies started in or around the Tulsa area. Houston’s biggest market is oil as well (although they might be a wee bit bigger of a market). I think the only school that would even be on the same level as Houston would be SMU just because it’s the easiest school to travel to.
